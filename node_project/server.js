// ** R E V I E W ** â€”> I love when people put creative twists on the assignments. Nice touches from the css,

// good design choice to only use the API for search. You also address many issues that some people might
// overlook or not know how to handle, such as handling bad results from a search. All in all there's little
// to criticize, so keep up the hard work and putting your own personal touches and you will have plenty to show
